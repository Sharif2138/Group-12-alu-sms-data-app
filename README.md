# MoMo Transactions Dashboard!
Welcome to our MTN MoMo Transactions Dashboard – this platform helps visualize and analyze mobile money transactions of MTN Mobile Money.

This is a simple and interactive dashboard that lets you sort and visualize transactions from MTN MoMo SMS data. For every transaction: incoming money, payments, withdrawals, or transfers, this dashboard has got you covered!

1. The MoMo data is first cleaned and categorized using Python and is written to a csv file.

2. To Store the data, we used sqlite3 and a python program that sends the data from thecsv file straight to the database.

3. The data is then fetched from the database and converted for it to be displayed on the frontend. Here Python Flask was used and it runs as an API so that the Javascript for the frontend can run on that specific API that contains the data.

# Languages

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. HTML & CSS

# How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the app.py to run the Flask API.
